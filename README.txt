A stock ordering/management system that produces invoices upon a new 'sale'. Utilises Swing (GUI) and iText library (exporting stock report to PDF).
This was developed for my Graded Unit 2 project during the second year of my studies.
The project is unfinished due to being developed alongside other modules and to a strict time constraint.
